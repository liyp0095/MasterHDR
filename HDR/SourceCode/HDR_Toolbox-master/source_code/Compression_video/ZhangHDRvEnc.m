%       ZhangHDRvEnc(hdrv, name, hdrv_profile, hdrv_quality)
%
%
%       Input:
%           -hdrv: a HDR video stream, use hdrvread for opening a stream
%           -name: this is the output name of the stream. For example,
%           'video_hdr.avi' or 'video_hdr.mp4'
%           -hdrv_profile: the compression profile (encoder) for compressing the stream.
%           Please have a look to the profile of VideoWriter from the MATLAB
%           help. Depending on the version of MATLAB some profiles may be not
%           be present.
%           -hdrv_quality: the output quality in [1,100]. 100 is the best quality
%           1 is the lowest quality.
