%        Input:
%           -img: input HDR image
%           -folder_name: the folder where to fetch the exposure stack in
%           the case img=[]
%           -format: the format of LDR images ('bmp', 'jpg', etc) in case
%                    img=[] and the tone mapped images is built from a sequence of
%                    images in the current folder_name
%           -imageStack: an exposure stack of LDR images; in case img=[],
%                        and folder_name='' and format=''
%           -wE: the weight for the well exposedness in [0,1]. Well exposed
%                pixels are taken more into account if the wE is near 1
%                otherwise they are not taken into account.
%           -wS: the weight for the saturation in [0,1]. Saturated
%                pixels are taken more into account if the wS is near 1
%                otherwise they are not taken into account.
%           -wC: the weight for the contrast in [0,1]. Strong edgese are 
%                taken more into account if the wE is near 1
%                otherwise they are not taken into account.
%           -bMertensDebug: a debugging flag to turn on/off the gamma
%           encoding notice.
%
%        Output:
%           -imgOut: tone mapped image
%
%        Note: Gamma correction is not needed because it works on gamma
%        corrected images.
