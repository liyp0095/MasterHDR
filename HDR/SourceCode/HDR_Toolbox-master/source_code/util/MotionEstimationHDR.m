%        motionMap = MotionEstimationHDR(img1, img2, blockSize)
%
%       This computes motion estimation between HDR frames
%
%       input:
%         - img1: source
%         - img2: target
%         - blockSize: size of the block
%         - bVisualize
%
%       output:
%         - motionMap: motion map for each pixel
