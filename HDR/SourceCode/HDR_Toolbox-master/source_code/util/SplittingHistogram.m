%        pivot = SplittingHistogram(histo)

%
%        Input:
%           -histo: input histogram
%
%        Output:
%           -pivot: the pivot value for splitting the histogram in two
%           sub-histograms with similar sums:
%              MIN { sum(histo(1:pivot)) - sum(histo((pivot+1):end)) }
