function imgOut = ColorCorrectionLinear(img, mantiuk_p)

%       imgOut = ColorCorrectionLinear(img, mantiuk_p)
%
%       This function saturates/desaturates colors in img
%
%       input:
%         - img: an image
%         - mantiuk_p: the saturation correction's factor with values in
%           [0,1]; it can be a gray scale image
%
%       output:
%         - imgOut: corrected values

%is it a three color channels image?

imgOut = zeros(size(img));

for i=1:size(img, 3);
    M = (img(:,:,i) ./ L);
    Mc = (M - 1.0) .* mantiuk_p + 1.0;
    imgOut(:,:,i) = Mc .* L;
end

imgOut = RemoveSpecials(imgOut);
