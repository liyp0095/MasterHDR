HOW TO INSTALL:
===============
1) Unzip the file HDRToolbox.zip in a FOLDER on your PC/MAC

2) Run Matlab

3) Set the FOLDER as current directory

4) Write the command installHDRToolbox in the Command Window, and wait for the installation process to end.


NOTE ON TONE MAPPING:
=====================
The majority of TMOs return tone mapped images with linear values. This means that gamma encoding
needs to be applied to the output of these TMOs before visualization or before writing tone mapped images
 on the disk; otherwise these images may appear dark.
A few operators (e.g. Mertens et al.'s operator) return gamma encoded values,
so there is no need to apply gamma to them; in this case a message (e.g. a Warning) is displayed
after tone mapping alerting that there is no need of gamma encoding.
